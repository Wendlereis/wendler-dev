Hello World!

Welcome to my personal blog, here you'll find all my attempts to learn something 
new! This is the very beginning of a series of posts about all the awesome tech 
things that challenge us.

I want to help you to learn something with my achivements and my mistakes, where 
all learnings come from! 

Join me to keep learning and growing, step by step every single day!

*Let's keep coding!*
