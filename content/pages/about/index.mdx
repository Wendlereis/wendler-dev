How you doing?

My name is Wendler Eis, 22yo, ISTJ and I have two little dogs!

I graduated in 2018 in information systems on FIAP but my tech journey started when I first saw something like:


```
algoritmo OlaMundo 
  
inicio 
  escreva("OlÃ¡, Mundo!") 
fim
```


> The code above is a structured language called **portugol**

Since then, I started to know more and more how software development works by creating my own applications. 

My first job as intern was in a infrastructure team, and my main activity was to format and reinstall Windows in others laptops. 

After that I got a job as junior developer using .Net in legacy projects. I will never forget that once I saw a comment saying that the next few lines were wrote in early 00', that time I was only 5 

Then I got my first dream role as a frontend engineer in a wedding website startup. Today I'm working at Gymapass where I can apply all my software knowledge and learn so much more from others awesome developers who helps me lot 

This is my brief history, and every day I'm learning and growing my skills to the thing I love the most.

Join me to keep learning and growing, step by step every single day!

*Let's keep coding!*
