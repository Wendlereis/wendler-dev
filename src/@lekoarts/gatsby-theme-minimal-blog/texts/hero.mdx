# Hi! 

I'm wendler a Brazilian frontend engineer who loves Javascript and pop culture.

Nowadays I'm working at *[Gympass](https://gympass.com)* to help others to find an activity to love and defeat the inactivity.

Here you will find my very deepest thoughts like â€” If a cornfield catches fire, does it turns popcorn? Why use Javascript for everything could be interesting? What is today's meme? Should I invest my money or just buy a taco? And much more.

Take a cup of coffee or two, sit comfortable and join me to discover more about life, the universe and everything!
